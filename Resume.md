## About Me

I have a strong passion for entertaining others and making tools for convenience. With a recent interest in performance, I strive to write efficient and maintainable code. I absolutely enjoy working with infrastructure and keeping the toolchain centralized. I've used Linux for 5 years and have been using Docker for 3 years.

## Education

- Self-taught for 5 years, working mainly with C#
- Took a year-long programming course in high school, which taught the basics of Java and OOP​.

## Projects

- [Cookie Clicker](https://github.com/OoLunar/CookieClicker): A simple cookie clicker game written in C#. It uses HTTP Interactions, Postgres, Remora, Serilog, and GenHTTP.
- [Tomoe](https://github.com/OoLunar/Tomoe): My Discord bot that I've been working on ever since I started programming. Tomoe uses EFCore with targeted Postgres support, DSharpPlus, DSharpPlus.CommandAll, LiveChartsCore, and Serilog.
- [DSharpPlus.CommandAll](https://github.com/OoLunar/DSharpPlus.CommandAll): A command framework for DSharpPlus. It combines DSharpPlus.CommandsNext and DSharpPlus.SlashCommands into a single command framework.
- [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus/): A Discord API wrapper for .NET. I was invited to join the DSharpPlus team as the lead dev in April 2021.

## Languages

- C# (5 years). I mainly focus on performance, readability, and functionality when using C#. I've used it for a variety of projects including Discord bots, HTTP servers, and infrastructure tools. I manually write my `.csproj` files to add functionality that Visual Studio or Rider doesn't easily expose (such as Tasks, Source Generators, and Post Build Events)​.
- Rust (6 months). I've used Rust for a variety of projects including a Discord bot, a CLI tool, and a HTTP server. I'm familiar with the borrow checker, lifetimes, and the concept of ownership. I've used Tokio and Actix-Web for asynchronous programming and HTTP servers, respectively. I've also used Serde for serialization and deserialization.
- HTML/JS/CSS (1 year and 6 months). I've used HTML, JS, and CSS for a variety of projects. A project I'm most proud of is OrbSmith, an OBS stream overlay for displaying which song is currently playing. I'm familiar with the DOM, the concept of asynchronous programming, and the basics of CSS.
- Bash (5 years). Bash is essential for creating infrastructure. It's used often within my VPS and Docker images. I'm familiar with the basics of Bash, such as variables, functions, and loops. I've also used `jq` for JSON parsing and `curl` for HTTP requests.
- PostgreSQL and SQLite (4 years). I've used both PostgreSQL and SQLite for a variety of projects. I'm familiar with the basics of SQL, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data. I've also used EFCore for database migrations and querying data.
- Docker (3 years). I've used Docker for a variety of projects. I'm familiar with the basics of Docker, such as creating images, creating containers, and using Docker Compose. I've written Docker images from scratch for my own projects for ease of use and security.

## Libraries

- DSharpPlus
- EFCore
- Humanizer
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- Npgsql
- Serilog
- System.Reflection
- Ulid

## VPS Experience

- Familiar with Debian and Debian-based distros.
- Daily drives Void Linux.
- Intimate knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose.
- Written Docker images from scratch for my own projects.
- Set up a Wireguard VPN server using secure features such as pre-shared keys and a private DNS server ([dnscrypt](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy)).
- Uses Nginx and Lets-Encrypt to manage my HTTP server.
