- I’m currently working on [Numakura, An optimizable web server](https://github.com/OoLunar/Numakura)

- I’m looking to get some collaborators on [Rin, A chat client](https://github.com/OoLunar/Rin)

- My website and project showcasing is over at [ForSaken Borders](https://forsaken-borders.net)

- I'm wanting to learn C++ and Unreal Engine

- I know Bash, C#, Rust, HTML-CSS-JS and Java fluently. I'm always down for helping on those languages.

- Reach me at lunar@forsaken-borders.net

- Fun fact: All my projects are based off of random Japanese names!
