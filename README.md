<h3 align="center">C# and Void Linux enthusiast.</h3>

I am Lunar Starstrum, an individual with a deep interest in C# and Void Linux. I serve as the Maintainer of HyperSharp, a C# implementation of the HTTP 1.1 protocol. Additionally, I am the Creator of Cookie Clicker, a .NET cookie-clicking Discord bot.

My interests lie in low-level general concepts, including concurrency, async/await, micro-benchmarking, and the intricacies of networking protocols. I occasionally embrace and encourage my moments of ignorance as part of the learning process.

In the world of C#, I am well-acquainted with reflection and continuously explore new possibilities through my own custom source generators. I find enjoyment in working with infrastructure tools such as Bash, Docker, and Github Actions.

If you'd like to connect or explore more about my work, you can find me at my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/OoLunar) and support my chaos on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/OoLunar).

I do not entertain requests related to web development. Attempting to engage me on this subject will result in immediate blocking, as I have negative interest in web development. I will not respond to any requests related to web development. I do not like web development. You're on thin ice if you mention backend development.

You can reach me via email at lunar@forsaken-borders.net, send me a direct message on Discord under the handle [@OoLunar](https://discord.com/users/336733686529654798), or join my Discord community at https://discord.gg/6bjPzA8P6h. I look forward to having you around!
