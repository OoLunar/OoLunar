<h3 align="center">C# and Linux enthusiast.</h3>

I am Lunar Starstrum, an individual whose passion lies within C# and Linux. I've been helping maintain one of .NET's biggest Discord libraries [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus/) since 2021, a project which has over 3 million collective downloads on .NET's NuGet. The fastest commit-to-deployment I've ever done was in an hour through [CloudflareRouteTracker](https://github.com/OoLunar/CloudflareRouteTracker/). The oldest project I have is a Discord quality-of-life bot called [Tomoe](https://github.com/OoLunar/Tomoe/), a project I've been working on since July 2020. If you want to see how I've evolved as a programmer, or how I program now, that's a good repository to start at.

My interests lie in low-level general concepts, including concurrency, async/await, micro-benchmarking, and the intricacies of networking protocols. In the world of C#, I am well-acquainted with reflection and continuously explore new possibilities through my own custom source generators. I find enjoyment in working with infrastructure tools such as Bash, Docker, and Github Actions.

If you'd like to connect or explore more about my work, you can find me at my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/OoLunar) and support me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/OoLunar).

I don't do frontend. Any requests for frontend work will be ignored.

You can reach me via email at lunar@forsaken-borders.net, send me a direct message on Discord under the handle [@OoLunar](https://discord.com/users/336733686529654798), or join my Discord community at https://discord.gg/6bjPzA8P6h. I look forward to having you around!
